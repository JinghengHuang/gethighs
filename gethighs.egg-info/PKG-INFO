# gethighs

A Python interface to using HiGHS executable files on Pyomo.

## Current alternatives

### Appsi solvers

Pyomo has currently HiGHS appsi solver implemented, which works very well for systems in which *highspy* is available (and stable).

You can install highspy directly from pip (make sure pyomo and pybind11 are installed)

```
pip install highspy
```

And import the appsi solver from the following path:

```python
from pyomo.contrib.appsi.solvers import Highs
```

Use it as any pyomo solver from solver factory and be happy! Unless you have some trouble with highspy... And you might, as I did.

If that's your case, keep with me a few more lines.

## Downloading executables

First, make sure you have a highs executable file available in your computer.

You can find HiGHS static executable files pre-compiled for several systems on [this link](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/HiGHS_jll.jl/releases).

More information is available on [HiGHS github page](https://github.com/ergo-code/highs).

After dowloading the executables, it helps if they are included in system (or user) path. You might need no reinitialize your computer after this.

## Installing gethighs

gethighs is a small Python package which I developed for using HiGHS directly from executable files via the Pyomo interface. You can install it via pip + the github link:

``pip install -e git+https://github.com/bruscalia/gethighs#gethighs``

And also use it *almost* as a native pyomo solver.
